This React Native bug involves unexpected behavior with the `FlatList` component when using a custom `renderItem` function.  The issue arises when the data array passed to `FlatList` is updated, but the UI doesn't reflect the changes immediately. Sometimes, old data remains visible, even though the internal state of the component shows the updated data.  This happens inconsistently, making debugging challenging.  I've tried various methods like `keyExtractor`, `extraData`, and force updating the state, but none have consistently resolved the issue. The inconsistency makes it hard to pinpoint the exact conditions causing the problem.
