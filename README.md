# React Native FlatList UI Update Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native's `FlatList` component where UI updates are not always consistent with data changes.  The `FlatList` component sometimes fails to update its UI immediately, even after the data source is updated. This issue occurs inconsistently across various data manipulations and has resisted standard solutions such as `keyExtractor` and `extraData`. 

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component inconsistently fails to reflect data changes in its rendered UI, despite the underlying data state being correct. The inconsistency makes the bug hard to reproduce and debug.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or the appropriate command for your platform).
4. Observe the inconsistent updates of the FlatList items.  This may require several data updates and/or different devices to consistently reproduce.

## Solution

The solution provided uses a combination of techniques including `keyExtractor`, force updates using a `ref` and potentially additional improvements to ensure the data changes are consistently reflected in the UI.
